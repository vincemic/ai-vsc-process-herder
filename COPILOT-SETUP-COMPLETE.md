# ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot MCP Server Setup Complete

## What's Been Configured

Your VS Code workspace is now fully configured for GitHub Copilot to use the "process-herder" MCP server for intelligent process management during testing and debugging workflows.

### ‚úÖ Completed Configuration Steps

1. **VS Code Settings**: The `.vscode/settings.json` file includes the GitHub Copilot MCP server configuration:
   ```jsonc
   "github.copilot.chat.mcpServers": {
     "process-herder": {
       "command": "node",
       "args": ["${workspaceFolder}/build/index.js"],
       "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
       "env": {
         "PROCESS_HERDER_SILENT_RECOVERY": "1"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Copilot Instructions**: Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with comprehensive guidance on:
   - When to use the process-herder MCP server
   - Available MCP tools (17 total)
   - Usage patterns and workflows
   - Process roles and classification
   - Readiness probes and singleton management
   - Example workflows for common scenarios

3. **MCP Server Built**: The TypeScript project has been compiled and is ready to use

4. **Documentation Created**:
   - `.github/copilot-mcp-guide.md` - Detailed usage guide for GitHub Copilot
   - `.github/copilot-integration-verification.md` - Testing and verification guide

### üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools for GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot now has access to these process management tools:

#### Core Process Management
- `list-tasks` - List VS Code tasks from tasks.json
- `start-task` - Execute VS Code tasks by name
- `start-process` - Launch custom commands with advanced options
- `stop-process` - Stop running processes
- `restart-process` - Restart processes
- `list-processes` - View all managed processes
- `get-process-status` - Get detailed process information

#### Test Run Orchestration
- `start-test-run` - Coordinate multi-process test execution
- `get-test-run-status` - Check test run status
- `list-test-runs` - List all test runs
- `abort-test-run` - Stop test runs

#### Advanced Features
- `detect-project-type` - Analyze project structure
- `get-health-summary` - System health overview
- `get-process-logs` - View and filter process logs
- `get-process-metrics` - Performance metrics
- `configure-recovery` - Set up auto-recovery
- `export-diagnostics` - Export debug data
- `get-vscode-status` - Check VS Code integration

### üéØ What GitHub Copilot Can Now Do

When you ask GitHub Copilot to help with development workflows, it will automatically use the process-herder to:

1. **Start Development Servers**:
   - "Start the development server" ‚Üí Uses `start-task` or `start-process`
   - Automatically detects appropriate tasks from your `tasks.json`
   - Uses singleton behavior to prevent duplicate processes
   - Waits for readiness before reporting success

2. **Run Tests**:
   - "Run the tests" ‚Üí Uses test orchestration tools
   - Can coordinate backend + frontend + test processes
   - Monitors test execution and reports results
   - Handles test failures gracefully

3. **Debug Issues**:
   - "Check what's running" ‚Üí Uses `list-processes`
   - "Why is my server failing?" ‚Üí Uses `get-process-logs` and `get-health-summary`
   - "Restart the failed service" ‚Üí Uses `restart-process`

4. **Build and Deploy**:
   - "Build the project" ‚Üí Uses `start-task "build project"`
   - "Clean and rebuild" ‚Üí Uses `start-task "clean build"` then build
   - Monitors build progress and reports completion

### üß™ Quick Test

To verify everything is working, try asking GitHub Copilot:

```
"Use process-herder to list the available VS Code tasks in this workspace"
```

GitHub Copilot should respond by using the MCP server to show your configured tasks:
- install dependencies
- build project
- start mcp server
- test mcp server
- lint code
- format code
- clean build

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Reload VS Code** to ensure the MCP server configuration is active
2. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** and test the integration
3. **Use natural language** to request development tasks
4. **Let Copilot choose** the appropriate process-herder tools automatically
