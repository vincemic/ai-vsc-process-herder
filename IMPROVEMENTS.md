# VS Code Process Herder - Enhanced Reliability Features

This document outlines the major improvements made to the VS Code Process Herder MCP server to enhance its reliability, monitoring capabilities, and process tracking accuracy.

## üéØ Executive Summary

The enhanced Process Herder now provides enterprise-grade process management with:
- **Advanced Health Monitoring** - Real-time process health assessment
- **Intelligent Auto-Recovery** - Automatic healing of failed processes
- **Persistent State Management** - Process state survives restarts and crashes
- **Comprehensive Logging & Metrics** - Full observability into process behavior
- **Proactive Issue Detection** - Early warning system for potential problems

## üîß New Components

### 1. Health Monitor (`health-monitor.ts`)

**Purpose**: Continuously monitors process health and detects issues before they become critical.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time health scoring (0-100)
- Memory leak detection
- CPU usage monitoring
- Unresponsive process detection
- Health history tracking
- Configurable thresholds

**Health Metrics**:
```typescript
interface HealthCheckResult {
  pid: number;
  name: string;
  isHealthy: boolean;
  healthScore: number; // 0-100
  issues: HealthIssue[];
  lastCheck: Date;
  metrics: ProcessMetrics;
}
```

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Get health summary for all processes
get-health-summary

# View processes needing attention
get-process-status --processId 1234
```

### 2. Recovery Manager (`recovery-manager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Automatically detects and recovers from process failures using configurable strategies.

**Recovery Strategies**:
- **Error Recovery**: Restart processes with high error counts
- **Memory Recovery**: Handle memory leaks and high usage
- **Unresponsive Recovery**: Force restart hung processes
- **Health Score Recovery**: Restart unhealthy processes

**Configuration Example**:
```typescript
const strategy: RecoveryStrategy = {
  name: 'memory-restart',
  conditions: [{
    type: 'memory-usage',
    operator: 'gt',
    value: 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // 2GB
    duration: 60000 // 1 minute
  }],
  actions: [
    { type: 'notify', delay: 0 },
    { type: 'restart', delay: 5000 }
  ],
  maxAttempts: 1,
  cooldownPeriod: 300000, // 5 minutes
  enabled: true
};
```

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Configure recovery for a process
configure-recovery --processName "dev-server" --strategy "restart" --maxRestarts 3
```

### 3. State Manager (`state-manager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Persists process state across restarts and provides crash recovery capabilities.

**State Persistence**:
- Process metadata and configuration
- Environment variables
- Working directories
- Port assignments
- Dependency tracking
- Session management

**Recovery Features**:
- Automatic process recovery after crashes
- State snapshots for debugging
- Session continuity
- Import/export capabilities

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Export current state for backup
export-diagnostics --includeState true

# View session information
get-vscode-status
```

### 4. Logging Manager (`logging-manager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive logging and metrics collection with advanced filtering and analysis.

**Logging Features**:
- Structured logging with levels (debug, info, warn, error, critical)
- Category-based organization
- Advanced filtering and search
- Log statistics and reports
- Automatic log rotation

**Metrics Collection**:
- Counter metrics (process starts, errors, etc.)
- Gauge metrics (CPU, memory usage)
- Histogram metrics (response times, durations)
- Time-series data with automatic cleanup

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Get filtered logs
get-process-logs --level error --category "recovery" --limit 50

# View metrics for a specific metric
get-process-metrics --metricName "cpu-usage"
```
