# Installation Instructions for v1.1.1

## ‚úÖ Working Installation Methods

Since we've fixed the dependency issues, here are the recommended ways to install the VS Code Process Herder MCP server globally:

### Method 1: Local Package Installation (Recommended)

1. Download or clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vincemic/ai-vsc-process-herder.git
cd ai-vsc-process-herder
```

2. Install dependencies and build:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Create and install the package:
```bash
npm pack
npm install -g ./vscode-process-herder-mcp-1.1.1.tgz
```

4. Verify installation:
```bash
vscode-process-herder --help
```

### Method 2: Direct from Release Asset (When Available)

Once GitHub releases are set up:
```bash
# Download the .tgz file from GitHub releases
npm install -g ./vscode-process-herder-mcp-1.1.1.tgz
```

## üêõ Known Issues

- **Windows + Git Installation**: `npm install -g git+https://github.com/...` has symlink issues on Windows (npm limitation)
