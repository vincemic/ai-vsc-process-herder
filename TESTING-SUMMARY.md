## 🛠️ Key Features

### **Comprehensive Test Utilities**
- **MCPServerTestClient**: Full MCP protocol testing client
- **ProcessTestUtils**: Process management helpers
- **MCPAssertions**: Response validation utilities
- **Automated Setup/Teardown**: Clean test environment management

### **Test Configuration**
- **Sequential Execution**: Prevents process conflicts
- **Multiple Report Formats**: HTML, JSON, JUnit
- **Retry Logic**: Handles flaky tests in CI environments
- **Isolated Test Environment**: Dedicated test workspace

## 🚀 Available Commands

```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
npm run test:playwright

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:mcp           # MCP server tests
npm run test:process       # Process management tests
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
npm run test:performance   # Performance tests

# Interactive testing
npm run test:playwright:ui     # Visual test runner
npm run test:playwright:debug  # Debug mode
npm run test:playwright:headed # See browser actions

# Utilities
npm run test:cleanup       # Clean up test environment
npm run test:all          # Jest + Playwright tests
```

## 📊 Test Results Summary

### ✅ **Passing Tests**: 35+ tests
- All core MCP functionality working
- Task management fully operational  
- Health monitoring and recovery working
- Integration workflows functioning
- Performance within acceptable limits

### ⚠️ **Minor Issues Identified**:
- Windows-specific command execution differences (handled)
- Test cleanup improvements needed (implemented)
- A couple of edge case assertions to refine

## 🔧 Test Environment

### **Automated Setup**
- Builds project before testing
- Creates isolated test workspace
- Generates test tasks.json and package.json
- Sets up clean environment per test run

### **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **Protocol Testing**: MCP message handling
- **Functional Testing**: All tool operations
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Load and scalability
- **Error Testing**: Graceful failure handling

## 📈 Benefits Achieved
